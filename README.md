# AI-Product-Design-Blueprint-Assistant
AI Product Design &amp; Blueprint Assistant -Product ideas often come in unstructured formats (emails, tickets, chats), leading to unclear expectations and misaligned architecture. This tool transforms natural language product feature briefs into interactive, structured technical specs and system diagrams in real-time.

**Tech Stack Used**
Cursor AI
Python
REACT
FastAPI
Uvicorn
Jinja2
spaCy
en_core_web_sm (spaCy model)
Mermaid.js
Gemini AI API

*User Story:** "As a user, I want to register an account with my email and password, and then be able to log in securely. The system should store user data in a database and send a welcome email upon successful registration."

**How**
Phase: AI Integration (spaCy and LLM)
Step: Integrate spaCy and LLM Call in FastAPI Backend
The backend receives a product feature brief (or, with chat support, a conversation history).
It constructs a prompt and sends it to the Google Gemini API (an advanced AI large language model).
The Gemini API processes the prompt and returns:
A structured technical specification (in Markdown)
A Mermaid.js diagram (for system architecture/flow)
**
why**
The AI (Gemini) is responsible for understanding natural language input, analyzing requirements, and generating both technical documentation and diagrams automatically.
